## Acknowledgements

I wanna shout out Codecademy for a surprisingly cost-effective and contentful course. Before I started it, it had been a couple years since I'd checked it out and they've come a long way. I have a lot of opinions on how they could improve the course but overall, pretty good for what it is!
